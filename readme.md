# Unserialize.dev

A quick-and-dirty PHP script to unserialize a string in PHP.

[Clone](https://github.com/macbookandrew/unserialize.dev/archive/master.zip) (or [download](https://github.com/macbookandrew/unserialize.dev/archive/master.zip) and expand the zip file) into your documents root and point [unserialize.dev](http://unserialize.dev) to the folder.

Enter your serialized data into the `textarea`, submit, and boom!—your serialized data is expanded to a much more human-readable view!

Created for use with this [Alfred custom search](alfred://customsearch/Unserialize/uns/utf8/nospace/http%3A%2F%2Funserialize.dev%3Finput%3D%7Bquery%7D) (note that if your serialized string is longer than 4,000 characters, it may cause a 414 “Request Too Long” error).
